Kuehne-nagel exercise for IT selection process.


Was created a controller for this microservice. 
This service is a POST and the header is 'application/xml'.
In the requisition's body, is passed a XML sent in email as example.
There's some validations for convert this XML in a Java object.
The link for test this service is this:
